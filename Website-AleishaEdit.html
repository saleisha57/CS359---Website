				<center style="color:white;">Malware from Streaming: My Thoughts</center>
				<p class=".tab">The article I read is "How Illegal Streams can Help Criminals Steal Your Money" from Independent. This article discusses the use of websites that are pirating shows, movies, and many more media sources to plant malware on the user's system. The article goes into the warnings that are given about using illicit websites. I have never thought about some of points made in this article, such as the owners of the sites allowing malware to be placed into links if the creator of the malware is willing to pay them. I feel that my eyes were opened even more after reading this article, especially when the information about a hacker's tactics was brought up.</p>
				<p>The quotes and information provided by security researchers points out the issues with exposing yourself to these sites. I think it is smart that they bring up ransomware, malware, and the dark web to show that there are many different methods used by the criminals to gather information from a user. This article does a great job of framing these types of attacks in a way that makes them understandable to people who may not know the methods used by hackers. I have noticed that people tend to have the "I will not be targeted" view of these situations, and do not realize that they are in fact a target if they are exposed to infected links or sites.</p>
				<p>I do not trust most "free" streaming websites or the reasons stated in this article. My view on them has always been "just because it is popular does not mean it is safe." I chose to read this article because I see this sort of site used by several people around me quite frequently. I have heard from several people about their using of unofficial websites for streaming free shows. They almost constantly tell me I should use these sites to catch up on episodes I have missed of a show because it is free, and I always refuse trying to tell them that they are putting themselves at risk.</p>
