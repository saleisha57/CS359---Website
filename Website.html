				<center style="color:white;">Malware from Streaming: Aleisha's Thoughts</center>
				</font>
				<font size="+1">
				<p>The article I read is "How Illegal Streams can Help Criminals Steal Your Money" from Independent. This article discusses the use of websites that are pirating shows, movies, and many more media sources to plant malware on the user's system. The article goes into the warnings that are given about using illicit websites. I have never thought about some of points made in this article, such as the owners of the sites allowing malware to be placed into links if the creator of the malware is willing to pay them. I feel that my eyes were opened even more after reading this article, especially when the information about a hacker's tactics was brought up.</p>
				<p>The quotes and information provided by security researchers points out the issues with exposing yourself to these sites. I think it is smart that they bring up ransomware, malware, and the dark web to show that there are many different methods used by the criminals to gather information from a user. This article does a great job of framing these types of attacks in a way that makes them understandable to people who may not know the methods used by hackers. I have noticed that people tend to have the "I will not be targeted" view of these situations, and do not realize that they are in fact a target if they are exposed to infected links or sites.</p>
				<p>I do not trust most "free" streaming websites or the reasons stated in this article. My view on them has always been "just because it is popular does not mean it is safe." I chose to read this article because I see this sort of site used by several people around me quite frequently. I have heard from several people about their using of unofficial websites for streaming free shows. They almost constantly tell me I should use these sites to catch up on episodes I have missed of a show because it is free, and I always refuse trying to tell them that they are putting themselves at risk.</p>

				<center style="color:white;">Amplyfi: Aleisha's Research</center>
				</font>
				<font size="+1">
				<p>Amplyfi is a startup company in Cardiff, Wales that is known for using artificial intelligence to bore through the deep web. This company combines it’s services with other companies, and provides its deep learning algorithms for use along with other services and software. These algorithms are used for data recognition and identification while the AI program traverses the web. Based on the information that I have gathered about this company, it seems that Amplyfi is leading a shift in the use of AI in searching the web by altering how we interact with multiple aspects of the internet.</p>
				<p>The website is set up to allow easy access to gain knowledge about the company, view current news, and the types of businesses that they offer service for. Amplyfi offers two products, one called DataVoyant, and another called bespoke solution. DataVoyant is a software service that interprets open source content in both the deep web and the surface web. It is used to interpret people, companies, and behavior patterns among the web content. On the other end of the products is the bespoke solution. After researching this term, I discovered that a bespoke solution is something is custom made, and is created by a specific company. In regards to Amplyfi, the only way to get information on this solution is to contact them directly.</p>
				<p>On the website, there is a section about understanding what Amplyfi stands for. Amplyfi offers a news section to allow users to view current events revolving around the development of the company. The most recent post is from November last year. This article posting is about how the company works alongside the Welsh government. The loans from the government allow for the company to grow and expand, while offering large amounts of jobs in the community. </p>
				<p>This company also has another section for case studies. This section is dedicated to allowing companies to request case studies from the provided options. Amplyfi offers three selections, which are additive manufacturing, augmented reality, and Chinese shadow banking. These studies are set up to help gather information on how these affect the flow of business and competition.</p>

				<center style="color:white;">Theresa May warns web giants: Bao's Thoughts </center>
				</font>
				<font size ="+1">
				<p>British Prime Minister, Teresa May, is mentioned in this article to have articulated warnings to tech companies like Facebook and Google about a two hour deadline on removing extremist materials from the sites. The warning was the backed up with suggestions of large fines if the companies don’t do so. While reading this article, a question that was drawn to my attention was if these companies have any obligations to follow Theresa May’s warnings. It is hard to say what jurisdiction there is to this material since each regions have their own governing rules and perception of freedoms. Because of this, it might be more of a decision the tech companies have to make on whether this type of content should be censored. I have to disagree with May’s response to this because it infringes on the company’s rights and freedoms. By obligating a worldwide tech company to follow one region’s rule, it could be setting off a chain reaction where everything is censored since no one can agree on a “correct” perspective or a definition of decency. Although this article was made with good intention, raising awareness of the seriousness of terrorist groups using web-based means to spread their message, I believe the fines made the article less reliable in forming a long-term solution. </p>
				<p>There is also the grounds of ethical programming for the companies as well. From the article’s perspective, they see that these large companies have the means to do everything that is asked so why don’t they? One of the statements was that web firms will use their tech know-how to stop terrorist content appearing online in the first place. This to me raises concerns on how companies would pursue this. What this article could be hinting at is censorship discrimination where certain groups are targeted more than others to censor posts. With this suggestion, every post would have to be screen and analyzed first before being posted, infringing on privacy and some freedoms. Facebook for example could censor all posts from a specific group of people because its algorithms deemed them as a flag. What could this mean on ethical grounds and who gets to decide appropriate and inappropriate posts? In the long term, it could spread to affect everyone and limit the discussions and news information through Facebook.</p>
				<p>In the end, the article is stepping on some sensitive grounds with computer ethics. May’s seems to see the power in these large tech companies, the capabilities and resources behind them. However, this power is taken too lightly by the article and does not asses the moral implications and controversial perspectives in implementing what May’s wants. There needs to be a balance between censorship and freedom. This is hard to asses. However, making fines and forcing these companies into legal liability questions who controls our freedom online and through social media. </p>

				<center style="color:white;">Facebook UK: Justice's Research </center>
				</font>
				<font size ="+1">
				<p>The British expansion of Facebook is a subsidiary of Facebook in the US and operates outside of London, just to the west in Egham. The subsidiary of Facebook does not house any high-level executives for the company. This makes sense with Facebook UK and Facebook Ireland both being in relatively close proximity.</p>
				<p>Recently with new laws being passed by parliament involving tax breaks for companies to retrieve any resources from companies within the country and resources being imported come with a higher tax. This new reform persuaded Facebook UK to restructure where they got their resources and brought a lot of their resources into the UK. By doing this even though revenues quadrupled the tax that was paid did not quadruple. With this lower taxation has allowed this subsidiary to create new jobs, up to 500 for 2017. These jobs will allow this rather small subsidiary of Facebook to continue to grow especially in a modern technological environment such as the UK.</p>
				<p>With recent terrorist attacks happening within the UK the Prime Minister is looking for ways to bring this under control. One of the options on the table is making social media sites and search engines adhere to regulations that currently govern news organizations. This would mean that companies such as Facebook UK and Google are now responsible for everything that pops up on their website. Anything that the government finds illegal, such as terrorist propaganda, far-right propaganda, pornography, etc., can lead to fines for these companies. Currently for the former two there is a 15years prison sentence for viewing these topics online. Naturally these companies are trying to stop these laws, Facebook has put up $3.2M into preventing this law and Google has spent $6M on this as well.</p>

				<center style="color:white;">Echosec: Bao's Research </center>
				</font>
				<font size ="+1">
				<p>Echosec is a geo-mapping service that allows location based searching. The company provides a way to gather reliable information and analytics based on location. It is targeted for both small and large businesses wanting target specific audiences with marketing strategies. Echosec will go through social media and anything that has a location tag to find specific posts in your area or a targeted area. Currently, Echosec is used in Fortune 500 companies and global luxury brands.</p>
				<p>Along with the audience targeting use of Echosec’s product, it is also mean to provide more customer engagement. By using location based social media, businesses can tailor to the customers and provide more customer engagement, hosting events when the targeted area is most populated and encouraging more customer feedback. This is one of the most effective ways to grow a business. More social media means more business so knowing when and where to market your brand is an undeniably useful resource. It also allows customer to quickly find reputable businesses within their area, again making use of adverts and knowing where other customers tend to go.</p>
				<p>Another use for Echosec’s product is Geofencing for both marketing use and for news use. On the marketing side, Geofencing allows marketers to visually see on a map what’s trending where and the population size there. It allows for easy advertisement as well as a knowledge in the best location to spend marketing resources. The same concept can also be used for news. One of Echosec’s proposed uses was to use geofencing to distinguish between real and fake news by seeing the amount of posts in one area. If someone posts an event that’s happening, Echosec’s product will confirm it by checking if other people have posted something similar within the area. This eliminates random reports and fake events people try to promote on social media. It also serves to easily identify dangers as well such as wild fires. A proposed use is to use social media posts to map wild fires with open data. By analyzing all posts of a specific wildfire with the geo-location of the post or photo, Echosec can quickly estimate the spread of the fire and its general cluster and affecting area.</p>
